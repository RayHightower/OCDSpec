  <div class="description">
    Unit Testing for the Obsessive Compulsive, as all of us should be.
  </div>

  <p>OCDSpec is a TDD/BDD framework inspired by RSpec and Jasmine.  Unlike similar frameworks it does not depend on OCUnit, and has a silent command line runner for iPhone.  It's goals are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A BDD-style syntax similar to RSpec's.</li>
    <li>No dependencies on OCUnit, and a test runner that doesn't require seeing the iPhone/iPad simulator.</li>
    <li>A command line runner.</li>
    <li>Simple setup and use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Example</h2>

{% highlight objectivec linenos %}
#import "OCDSpec/OCDSpec.h"

CONTEXT(OCDSpecExpectation)
{
  __block MockObjectWithEquals *actualObject;

  describe(@"toBe", 

           it(@"does not fail if the two objects are the same",
              ^{
                  actualObject = [[[MockObjectWithEquals alloc] init] autorelease];

                  [expect(actualObject) toBe: actualObject];
              }),

           nil);
}
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>This is taken out of OCDSpecExpectation - OCDSpec is tested in itself - and demonstrates your basic test.  Let's walk through the code:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><code>#import "OCDSpec/OCDSpec.h"</code><p>Every test imports OCDSpec.h.</p></li>
    <li><code>CONTEXT(OCDSpecExpectation)</code><p>Each specification requires a context - the name of the context (in this case OCDSpecExpectation) must be unique.</p></li>
    <li><code>__block MockObjectWithEquals</code><p>A variable that will be avalilable to all the descriptions in this context.  OCDSpec uses Objective-C closures, so if you want to modify an object in the any it blocks you need to prefix it with the <code>__block</code> directive.</p></li>
    <li><code>describe(@"toBe"</code><p>This is a description of what you are testing - it takes a string and is followed by it blocks. For the time being it only descriptive.</p></li>
    <li><code>it(@"does not fail if the two objects are the same",</code><p>The beginning of an it "block."  `it` is actually a function that takes a string naming the intent of the spec, and an Objective-C block, and are called it blocks for short.  The Objective-C block is started with the <code>^{</code></p></li>
    <li><code>[expect(actualObject) toBe: actualObject];</code><p>This is the assertion. <code>toBe</code> means that actualObject should be the same as the expected object.  Important Note: The parameter to <code>expect()</code> <b>must</b> be an object so to use integers, booleans and other primitives they should be wrapped in an <code>NSNumber</code> or similar proxy.</p></li>
    <li><code>nil</code><p>describe takes nil terminated array of it blocks, and as such must end with nil.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <p>Command line runners exist for iOS and Mac development.  Development is very active, including adding templates and GUI test runners.</p>

  <h2>Dependencies</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>XCode for the compiler, but AppCode can be used for development.</li>
    <li>Objective-C 2.0 is required for the block syntax.</li>
    <li>Git is required for installation, but c'mon you knew that.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>The latest release of OCDSpec is distributed via the OCDSpec-Templates project, which uses XCode templates to make getting started easy.  To install them:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode
mkdir Templates
cd Templates
git clone git://github.com/paytonrules/OCDSpec-Templates.git
{% endhighlight %}

  <h2>Setting Up Your Project</h2>
  <p>Now that the templates are on your machine you can use OCDSpec much like you do OCUnit or any other project.  Either open an existing Objective-C project or create a new one, it can be Mac or iPhone, and then add an OCDSpec target via File->New Target or the Add Target button on the targets page.</p>

  <p><img src="images/template_menu.jpg"></p>

  <p>Every time you build this target it builds OCDSpec and runs any unit test.  Of course right now you don't have any, an inconvenience we will soon be rectifying.  You can use the file template to create your first test:</p>


  <h2>Matchers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><code>toBeEqualTo:</code><p>Check that two objects are equal, using the equalTo message.</p></li>
    <li><code>toBe:</code><p>Check that two objects are the same object in memory.</p></li>
    <li><code>toBeTrue:</code><p>Check that the value is "truthy" - TRUE, YES, true, non-zero, not nil.  You can also just use <em>expectTruth</em> such as <em>expectTruth([object initialized])</em></p></li>
    <li><code>toBeFalse:</code><p>Check that the value is "falsy" - FALSE, NO, false and nil.  You can use <em>expectFalse</em>.  Both <em>expectTruth</em> and <em>expectFalse</em> can be used without turning the boolean into an object.</p></li>
    <li><code>FAIL</code><p>Pass the Fail macro a string to fail arbitrarily.  Handy for exception testing.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Before/After</h2>

  <h2>Bleeding Edge Setup</h2>
  <p>If you want the latest and greatest version of OCDSpec you can use the bleeding edge setup, but I warn you, it's not easy.</p>
